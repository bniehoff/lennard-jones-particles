So, this plot reveals that the symplectic integrator is working.\n",

We try to initialize the simulation with a Maxwell distribution of velocities at the correct temperature; however, this process is not perfect, and there will initially be quite a lot of temperature drift.  During the Equilibration phase, we periodically measure the temperature of the system and adjust it by globally rescaling all velocities.  Eventually, the system should settle down and remain within our given temperature tolerance for a sufficiently long amount of time.  At that point, the Equilibration phase ends, and we move on to the Observation phase, where we can measure relevant quantities for equilibrium physics.\n",
