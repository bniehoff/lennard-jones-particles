# lennard-jonesium

Microcanonical simulation of the Lennard-Jones substance and analysis of phase transitions.
Completely rebuilt in Python and modern C++ using object-oriented and functional programming
principles.

The project is mostly done. The C++ part (which does all the hard work) is working well. The
Python part has a basic interface which can be used to run simulations from a Jupyter notebook. 
More features are planned for running many simulations over a range of temperature and density
parameters.

To begin reading and understanding the code, I suggest starting with [design.md](src/design.md).
