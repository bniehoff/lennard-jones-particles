# lennard-jonesium

Microcanonical simulation of the Lennard-Jones substance and analysis of phase transitions.
Completely rebuilt in Python and modern C++ using object-oriented and functional programming
principles.

The project is not yet finished.  For now, it is possible to build and run the C++ tests with
CMake.  Eventually one will be able to build and install the Python package, but the project is not
yet configured for this.
