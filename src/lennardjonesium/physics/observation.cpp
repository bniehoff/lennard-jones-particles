         * To compute the specific heat capacity, we must take some care.  Simple formulas for
         * heat capacity are usually given in terms of the fluctuations of the total energy,
         * in the canonical ensemble.  However, our simulation takes place in the microcanonical
         * ensemble, and the total energy is formally constant (naturally it has some
         * fluctuation, but this can be suppressed to arbitrarily high order by an appropriate
         * choice of symplectic integrator).  So we need an appropriate formula that is well-
         * defined in the microcanonical ensemble.  The following paper derives such a formula:

         * 
         * where C_V is the specific heat and <(dKE)^2> is the variance of the kinetic energy.
         * Since kinetic energy is proportional to temperature,
         * 
         *      <T> = 2 <KE> / (3 N)
